# calculator-TOP
The final project of the foundations course in Javascript. Supposed to demonstrate everything I've learned in the past couple of months in the foundations course.

2/19/2025 - Finally finished the project. I learned a lot about using event handlers and using the debugger/console.logs to debug the code and 
track what data is missing/not going to the right place. Also learned how to add keyboard support with event listeners listening to the entire 
DOM by using the document object, and also how to manage flexbox and the logic of calculators. This was a fun project with a lot of features to 
implement. Can't wait to see what more this course has to offer!!
